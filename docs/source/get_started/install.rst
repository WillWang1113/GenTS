Installation
=====

.. note::
    **GenTS** is under development, and we will release it to PyPI soon. For now, you can install it from the source code.

From source code
----------------

To use GenTS, we recommend creating a virtual environment with `python=3.10`, for example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/WillWang1113/GenTS.git
   $ conda create -n gents python=3.10
   $ conda activate gents

Then, install the required packages:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install -r requirements.txt

From PyPI
----------------
.. note::
    To be updated
